# Usage: bin/report <build-dir> <cache-dir> <env-dir>

# Produces a build report emitted to stdout, containing metadata about the build, that's
# consumed by the build system.
#
# This script is run for both successful and failing builds, so it should not assume the
# build ran to completion (e.g. PHP or other tools may not even have been installed).
#
# Failures in this script don't cause the overall build to fail (and won't appear in user
# facing build logs) to avoid breaking builds unnecessarily / causing confusion. To debug
# issues check the internal build system logs for `buildpack.report.failed` events.
#
# Note: The build system doesn't source the `export` script before running this script.
